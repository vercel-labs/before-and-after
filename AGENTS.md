# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for AI agents working on this project.

## Project Overview

Before-After is a library and Claude Code skill for capturing visual comparisons of web pages. It screenshots two URLs (before/after states), runs visual/DOM diffs, and generates PR-ready markdown tables with uploaded images.

## Directory Structure

This is a pnpm workspace monorepo with two packages:

```
before-and-after/
├── src/                       # Core library (npm package: before-and-after)

## Key Workflows

### Taking Screenshots

The skill uses `agent-browser` CLI:
```bash
agent-browser open "<url>"
agent-browser screenshot ~/Downloads/screenshot.png
```

### Uploading for PR Comments

```bash
./skill/scripts/upload-and-copy.sh before.png after.png --markdown
```

Outputs centered markdown table and copies to clipboard.

### Adding New Storage Adapters

1. Create `skill/scripts/adapters/<name>.sh`
2. Script must:
   - Accept file path as `$1`
   - Print uploaded URL to stdout
   - Exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure
3. Use via `IMAGE_ADAPTER=<name>`

## Testing

```bash
# Run all library tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suites
pnpm test:unit       # Unit tests (no browser)
pnpm test:browser    # Browser-based tests
pnpm test:integration # Full workflow tests

# Run site e2e tests
cd site && pnpm test:e2e
```

Test pages are in `tests/fixtures/pages/`. Each has `before.html` and `after.html`.

### Next.js Test App Scenarios

The test app at `tests/fixtures/apps/nextjs-sample` has 8 progressive scenarios:

| Route | Scenario | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `/1/*` | Entirely different | Light vs dark theme, different layouts |
| `/2/*` | Only h1 differs | Same page, different headline text |
| `/3/*` | Below the fold | Different testimonial (requires scroll) |
| `/4/*` | Modal content | Different content inside modal (requires click) |
| `/5/*` | Subtle button color | Blue vs indigo button |
| `/6/*` | Different image | Same layout, different product image |
| `/7/*` | Added badge | New badge element appears in nav |
| `/8/*` | Viewport-specific | Different content on mobile vs desktop |

Legacy routes `/before` and `/after` still work (same as scenario 1).

## Development

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the library
pnpm build

# Run the site dev server
cd site && pnpm dev
```

## Conventions

- Screenshots saved to `~/Downloads/` with `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-` prefix
- PR markdown uses centered alignment (`|:------:|`) for GitHub compatibility
- Adapters are standalone bash scripts with no dependencies beyond curl/gh

## Agentation Watch Mode

When the user says "watch mode", start a loop with `agentation_watch_annotations`:
- Call `agentation_watch_annotations` and wait for annotations.
- For each annotation: `agentation_acknowledge`, make the fix, then `agentation_resolve` with a short summary.
- Continue watching until the user says stop or a timeout is reached.
